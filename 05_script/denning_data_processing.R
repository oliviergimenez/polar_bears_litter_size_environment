# In the multinomial models, I'm considering females without cubs. But these females
# without cubs can be many things: females who lost their cub(s) of the year, females
# who lost their yearling(s), or their 2y old(s). They can also be females who 
# parted form their 2y old that they successfully raised.

# The lone females we want to consider are only the females who lost their cub(s)
# of the year. To select only these females, we can use denning records (derived
# from GPS and ear-tag data).
